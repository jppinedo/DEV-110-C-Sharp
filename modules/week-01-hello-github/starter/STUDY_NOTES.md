**Operating system:**
[What OS are you using? Windows, macOS, or Linux?]

Answer: macOS

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge during setup:**
[What was the hardest part? Installing software, configuring VS Code, understanding the terminal, or something else?]

Answer: configuring VS Code

**How you solved it:**
[Explain what you did to overcome the challenge - search online, ask for help, restart your computer, etc.]

Answer: I use AI when I get stuck

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand? Git commands, terminal navigation, C# syntax, or dotnet CLI?]

Answer: dotnet CLI is the only thing that I'm not familliar with. C# syntax will be challenging once we start actually writting code I guess.

## Understanding C# Basics

**What does `Console.WriteLine()` do?**
[Explain in your own words what this command does]

Answer: It outputs a line of text to the console or terminal.

**What is the purpose of `Program.cs`?**
[Why is this file important in a C# project?]

Answer: This file contains the actual code or logic that is the program.

**What does `dotnet run` do?**
[Explain what happens when you run this command]

Answer: It runned the Program.cs file.

## Git Workflow Understanding

**What is the difference between `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`?**
[Explain each command and when you would use it]

Answer:

- `git add` is for adding files to the staging area
- `git commit` is to create a new state or version of the code in the current branch
- `git push` is used to add the changes/states of the local repository to a remote repository

**Why do we create branches?**
[Explain the purpose of creating a student branch]

Answer: Branches are used to separate a specific change or series of changes in order to maintain a pure main branch that could be used as a starting point for other specific changes. This can help teams work on multiple changes at the same time without worrying about overriding each other or changing the same files.

## What I Learned

**Key takeaways from this week:**
[What are the 3 most important things you learned?]

1. How to instal .NET
2. What to expect about the course
3. How to submit assingments

**How this connects to professional development:**
[Why are these skills important for programmers?]

Answer: Programmers do not write code in 100% of their time, much of the process has to do with ensuring the project integrity, structure, legibility, availability, compatibility, etc. Tools like Git, remote repositories, team protocols, etc, are essential to ensure the codebase is structured, maintainable, and scalable.

## Time Spent

**Total time:** 2 hours

**Breakdown:**

- Installing and configuring software: 10 minutes (already had most of it installed)
- Learning terminal/command line basics: 10 minutes
- Writing the "Hello, GitHub!" program: 1 minute
- Understanding Git workflow: 5 minutes
- Testing and fixing issues: 10 minutes
- Writing documentation: 30 minutes

**Most time-consuming part:** Watching the necessary videos

Answer: Watching the necessary videos was the most time consuming. The videos about Git didn't teach me much that I didn't knew, but I wanted to make sure I saw them in case I missed something.
